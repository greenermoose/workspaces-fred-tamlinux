# Changelog

All notable changes to `fred.workspaces` (`workspaces-fred-tamlinux`) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.5.2] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- Keep the existing permissions on Omarchy's shared state directory while writing
  plugin state; status reads no longer create that directory.
- Make `status` and `indicator` read-only commands by skipping topology resolution
  and its monitor-state update.
- Cover Home Manager symlinked desktop-mode configuration with a regression test.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed
- **Unused-monitor tracking acts on settled state, not on the first event.** The helper's own set
  operations (`switch`, `realign`, `reconcile`) focus every monitor in turn and move workspaces
  between them; until that batch settles, an unused monitor reads as focused or populated for a
  few milliseconds (seconds while the GPU is stalled, Fault F). `trackMonitorIdle()` acted on
  that at once: it re-lit a blanked monitor with nobody using it (HDMI-A-1, 2026-09-18 08:04) and
  reset the blank countdown on every desktop switch, so the monitor rarely blanked at all. An
  in-use sighting now settles for 400 ms and until every bar's helper process has exited, then
  `inUseReason()` is re-checked; transient sightings are ignored. Cursor entry still wakes the
  monitor, ~0.4 s later.
- **Bars adopt the monitor's real DPMS state.** A bar created while its monitor was already dark
  (shell restart, output re-added after an HPD drop) believed it lit and so could never wake it on
  cursor entry; the reverse left a lit monitor never blanked. Each bar now asks `hyprctl -j
  monitors` once at creation and on monitor change.

### Added
- **Version Footers**: Embedded running version in bar hover tooltips (`Workspaces.qml`) across all workspace buttons and desktop mode indicator.
- Blank and wake decisions are logged (`journalctl --user -t omarchy-shell | grep 'fred.workspaces
  idle'`) with the reason (`focused`, `windows`, `single-monitor`, `blanking-disabled`), including
  ignored transient sightings, timer arming, and stale-state corrections.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- **Per-Monitor Idle Blanking of Unused Monitors** (Plan 08):
  - Strictly event-driven monitor idle tracking embedded in `fred.workspaces` BarWidget; zero background polling preserving deep CPU C-states.
  - Monitors showing no application windows and without cursor focus power down individually via DPMS off after `unusedMonitorTimeout` (default 300 s, configurable via `omarchy bar set fred.workspaces unusedMonitorTimeout <seconds>`, 0 to disable).
  - Actively used monitors stay lit while unused companion monitors power down.
  - Immediate wake on cursor entrance (`focusedmon`), workspace change, or window activity (`openwindow`, `closewindow`, `movewindow`, `activewindow`).
  - Full Fault C protection: cold DPMS wake of `DP-2` (MSI MP161) triggers the verified modeset workaround (`msi-mp161-resume-workaround --once`) in background to retrain the link without blocking the shell.
  - Safe DPMS off/on dispatching via `omarchy-desktop-mode dpms-off <MON>` and `dpms-on <MON>` using `hl.dsp.dpms({ action = "...", monitor = "..." })` Lua table syntax.
  - `IpcHandler` for `fred.workspaces` exposing `resetIdle` across all bars via `omarchy-shell -q fred.workspaces resetIdle`, integrated with `msi-mp161-resume-workaround` to re-arm monitor idle countdowns upon global resume.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- **Hotplug reconcile while DPMS is off reset the idle timer** (2026-09-17 incident, `omarchy-config/agent/docs/incidents/2026-09-17-idle-loop-no-suspend.md`). The HP 22cwa drops HPD ~7 s after every DPMS-off blank and reconnects ~1 s later; since 1.4.1 that `monitorremoved` ran `reconcile`, whose `switch_windows()` focus dispatches made Hyprland re-evaluate idle inhibitors and — an upstream bug in `CIdleNotifyProtocol::setInhibit()` — reset every ext-idle-notify timer as if the user had touched the mouse. hypridle got `Resumed` 7–8 s after every blank, the screens came back on, and the 30-minute suspend rule never fired (85 cycles overnight). `reconcile` now reads `hyprctl monitors -j` first; when every enabled monitor reports `dpmsStatus == false` it still records the monitor set but skips the dispatch batch and prints `deferred: dpms off` (new `all_dpms_off()` helper, unit-tested). A dark desktop losing a panel is panel behaviour, not a topology change; Hyprland's own remembered-workspace logic restores the panel's workspace when it returns, and the first lit reconcile (Fault E: the Dell returning after resume, with DPMS already on) runs as before. The compositor side is fixed by the local Hyprland patch `0.56.2-3.2`; this guard makes the plugin correct on a stock Hyprland too.

## [Unreleased] (v1.4.2)

### Added
- **Split-set handling in Windows mode** (`splitSet` widget setting, `omarchy bar set fred.workspaces splitSet true|false`; Windows mode only — Omarchy and Mac modes treat each monitor individually). When something focuses a window on a hidden workspace (an app landing on a stale workspace, a window switcher, a single-monitor dispatch), Hyprland moves just that monitor:
  - `true` (default): the set splits, shown per monitor. A monitor that left the set's desktop shows a hollow marker on its own desktop and **F** (followed a focus) as the mode letter; hovering F says where it is versus the set, and clicking F returns just that monitor (new helper command `realign MONITOR DESKTOP`). Monitors still on the set's desktop keep the solid marker and **W**. Clicking any desktop or pressing `SUPER + number` (top row or keypad) moves the whole set.
  - `false`: the set does not split — every monitor follows to the focused monitor's desktop (300 ms debounce; only the bar on the focused monitor acts).

## [Unreleased] (v1.4.1)

### Fixed
- **Bar state never refreshed after creation**: `Workspaces.qml` parsed the FileView's cached `text()` inside `onFileChanged`, which Quickshell does not reload. Every bar instance kept the `desktop-monitors`/`desktop-mode` snapshot it was born with, so a bar rebuilt while a display was missing (Fault E on resume) stayed on a 2-monitor set size forever and showed phantom desktop 7 with no selection. Both watchers now `reload()` and the `status` run re-reads the file instead of the stale text.
- **`topology_size` config key was ignored**: `resolve_topology()` read a 2-tuple from `load_config_file()`, so the configured size never reached the grid. Now uses `load_full_config()`; covered by `test_configured_topology_size_widens_the_grid`.
- **Display hotplug reconcile never ran**: `Hyprland.rawEvent` hands the widget a `HyprlandIpcEvent` object, and the 1.4.0 handler called `indexOf` on it, throwing a `TypeError` on every event. The `monitoradded`/`monitorremoved` → `reconcile` path (R5) is now driven by `event.name`.
- **Two workspace engines**: the Home Manager copy of `omarchy-desktop-mode` behind the `SUPER + N` bindings was a pre-1.4.0 build (set size = active monitor count, no topology keys) and fought the bar's 1.4.0 helper over the state file. `home.nix` now installs the plugin's helper into `~/.local/bin`.

### Notes
- The Omarchy shell does not hot-reload plugin QML on Quickshell 0.3.1 (`Qt.clearComponentCache` is undefined, so the component cache is never cleared), and Qt's on-disk QML cache (`~/.cache/quickshell/qmlcache`) validates by source mtime only, which is a constant 1970 for Nix-store-deployed files. 1.3.1 and 1.4.0 were therefore never loaded — even across shell restarts — until the cache entry was purged. Deploy = purge + restart (`omarchy-qmlcache-purge && omarchy-restart-shell`).

## [Unreleased] (v1.4.0)

### Added
- **Topology-Anchored Workspace Grid ($K=3$)**:
  - Anchored workspace calculations to fixed physical workstation slots (Slot 0 = Left/MSI, Slot 1 = Center/Dell, Slot 2 = Right/HP).
  - Workspace IDs and desktop mappings never re-index when displays drop or reconnect.
  - Intermediate and endpoint monitors drop gracefully: missing slot workspaces remain parked in Hyprland without disturbing existing windows or spawning phantom desktops.
- **Automatic Geometric Gap Compression**:
  - Implemented `ensure_contiguous_layout()` to detect gaps ($X_i > X_{i-1} + W_{i-1}$) when intermediate monitors disconnect.
  - Dynamically repositions downstream displays (e.g. HP moved from $x=3840$ to $x=1280$) so pointer movement across screens is never blocked by Wayland coordinate geometry.
  - Automatically restores canonical monitor coordinates (`monitors.lua`) upon display return.
- **Resilient Two-Stage Switching**:
  - Replaced fatal all-or-nothing assertion crashes with two-stage verification and individual monitor retry fallbacks in `switch_windows`.
  - Guaranteed `desktop-current` recording so user intent is always preserved even during partial hardware lag.
- **Dynamic Hotplug Recovery & Reconcile**:
  - Hooked Hyprland `monitoradded` / `monitorremoved` socket2 events in `Workspaces.qml` with a 350ms debounce triggering `omarchy-desktop-mode reconcile`.
  - Returning monitors automatically attach to their slot's active workspace with zero manual intervention.
- **Bar UI Degraded Mode Feedback**:
  - `Workspaces.qml` evaluates under fixed `topologySize` ($K=3$).
  - Bar buttons 1–5 remain fixed across all bars.
  - Added degraded display state indication (`[X/Y Displays Active]`) to the mode button tooltip.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed
- **Center Monitor Indicator Desync & Atomic State Watch**:
  - Enabled `atomicWrites: true` on `modeFile` and `monitorsFile` `FileView` watchers in `Workspaces.qml` to prevent orphaned inotify watches across atomic file replacements.
  - Fixed monitor coordinate extraction in `quickshellMonitorNames()` and `isLeftMonitor()` to read `monitor.x` / `monitor.y`.
  - Added proactive `loadMonitors()` call on status process finish.
  - Bound `workspaceIds()` to `windowsRevision` for reactive workspace rendering.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- **Dynamic All-Monitor Windows Sets**:
  - Sized desktop sets dynamically to the number of active monitors, replacing 2-monitor hardcoding with multi-display set synchronization.
  - Verified batch dispatch and complete-set bar focus, occupancy, and tooltip presentation.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-13

### Security
- **Marketplace Verification**:
  - Verified and listed on the official [Omarchy Plugin Marketplace](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy-plugin-marketplace) with an automated security baseline rating of **Passed**.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Security
- **Strict Configuration & Process Hardening**:
  - Replaced shell execution and arbitrary sourcing of `desktop-mode.conf` with a strict key-value parser and monitor name validation regex.
  - Enforced closed process execution environments, argument parameterization, bounded outputs, and atomic state writes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- **`clonedFrom` Integration & Upstream Provenance**:
  - Declared `omarchy.clonedFrom: "omarchy.workspaces"` for clean in-place replacement and automatic rollback.
  - Documented upstream diff command and provenance in `UPSTREAM.md`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **Initial Release**:
  - Dynamic workspace indicator bar widget and multi-monitor desktop switcher (`omarchy`, `mac`, `windows` modes).
