# Acknowledgements — workspaces-fred-tamlinux

Researched 2026-10-09. Thank you to the people whose software, designs, maintenance, testing and public reports make this work possible.

Names are ordered alphabetically by the displayed public name (case and accents ignored for sorting). A self-published profile name is used when available; otherwise the public handle or name in an upstream credit is retained. No private identities, locations, phone numbers or commit-email harvesting are included. Affiliations below are self-reported public profile fields or explicitly attributed project roles; they are not independently verified employment records. Contact links and emails are only those publicly offered by the person or their project.

Tamlinux additions are distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Upstream works retain their own terms. Copyright notices are attributed to works and their stated holders, not inferred from contributor counts. The Free Software Foundation copyright on a GPL/LGPL license document is not treated as ownership of the software. These thanks supplement, and do not replace, required license and source notices.

[UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) records this repository’s code ancestry and design references. A runtime dependency, design inspiration, bug report and copied component are different contributions; the entries say which connection is established.

Omarchy component authors were checked against the public history through v4.0.4. Older clones are recorded in UPSTREAM.md; attribution to that component’s history does not mean every later change was copied into this plugin. Runtime and font credits identify upstream foundations, not co-authorship of Fred’s additions.

Each named entry identifies an authored component, a documented design influence, a specific change or public report, or responsibility for a foundation used by this repository. Contributor-roster membership alone is not enough for a named entry. Wider communities are credited collectively below.

**Version scope:** Hyprland credits describe the temporary Tamlinux 0.x platform and its compatibility patches. Tamlinux’s [public roadmap](https://github.com/greenermoose/tamlinux/blob/main/README.md) removes Hyprland at 1.0 in favor of Sway. Remove these dependency-only entries from future acknowledgements when the stack is no longer used. Historical forks and any retained derived code keep their applicable source notices.

## Community credit and coverage

We also thank the wider upstream communities: reviewers, translators, documentation writers, package maintainers, testers, issue reporters and accessibility contributors. The project/community links above recognize their wider work. This researched list emphasizes identifiable connections to this repository; it is not a complete census of every transitive dependency or a claim of endorsement. Public profiles and affiliations can change; the date above identifies this review.

The [Qt contributors](https://code.qt.io/), [Wayland contributors](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland), [Arch package maintainers](https://archlinux.org/people/) and their dependency communities provide additional foundations. Their licenses and copyright notices remain in the individual upstream projects and installed packages; no blanket ownership or single license is assigned to those communities.

The broader alphabetical list for the public Tamlinux ecosystem, including design, data, typeface, toolchain and planned-base contributions, is in [Tamlinux’s acknowledgements](https://github.com/greenermoose/tamlinux/blob/main/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md).

To correct a name, attribution, affiliation or contact preference, please open an issue in this repository or contact [Fred’s public account](https://github.com/greenermoose). Only evidence-backed additions should be made; do not infer identities behind pseudonyms.

Research and compilation were AI-assisted by Codex under Fred’s direction. AI systems and provider organizations are not listed as humans; existing AI provenance records, where present, describe their separate role.
